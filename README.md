# CVE-2020-9934

This Proof of Concept is a simple Swift program that will give itself and Terminal every kTCCService entitlement (pulled from tccd) and then do four things:
* Create a file named "<<<\<BYPASS>>>>" in the TCC-protected directory
* Read the data from said file from within the TCC-protected directory
* List all files in the TCC-directory (including "<<<\<BYPASS>>>>")
* Remove the file from the TCC-protected directory
